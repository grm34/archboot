## Thank you for taking the time to contribute to archboot! ♥

### Contributing

If you want to contribute to archboot project and make it better, your help is very welcome. Contributing is also a great way to learn more about social coding on Github, new technologies and and their ecosystems and how to make constructive, helpful bug reports, feature requests and the noblest of all contributions: a good, clean pull request.

### Reporting Issues

Found a problem? Want a new feature? First of all see if your issue or idea has [already been reported](https://github.com/grm34/archboot/issues).
If don't, just open a [new clear and descriptive issue](https://github.com/grm34/archboot/issues/new/choose).

### Help translate archboot

If you know another language and are willing to help translate archbboot, here are the steps to get started:

- Follow pull request guidelines as described below.
- Edit `.gitignore` file and remove the first line.
- Create a new file for your language in `locale` folder.
- Copy all the content of `locale/english` in to it.
- Implement your translations.
- Create a new pull request to submit your language.

### How to make a clean pull request

- Create a personal fork of the project on Github.
- Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on Github is called `origin`.
- Add the original repository as a remote called `upstream`.
- If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull `upstream` changes into your local repository.
- Create a new branch `dev` to work on!
- Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.
- Follow the code style of the project, including indentation.
- Add or change the wiki as needed.
- Squash your commits into a single commit with git's [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/about-git-rebase).
- Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote `origin`.
- From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the project's `dev` branch!
- Further changes are requested so just push them to your branch. The PR will be updated automatically.
- Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from `upstream` to your local repo and delete your extra branch(es).

And last but not least: Always write your commit messages in the present tense. Your commit message should describe what the commit, when applied, does to the code – not what you did to the code.
