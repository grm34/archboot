 Welcome in archboot, a script made with love by ${__author__}
${nc}
Arch Linux is a light and fast distribution whose concept
is to remain  as simple as possible.  In the same purpose
this script  performs  minimalist  installation,  it only
installs  the required  packages,  in order  to give free
choice to  the user.  Pretty simple,  it just  prompt for
hostname, username, password, which disk to use, required
partitions, language, timezone and if you wish to install
a desktop  environment.  According to the  chosen one and
in order  to get  complete  support, additional  packages
may be  required.  For more informations,  take a look in
the archboot wiki  https://github.com/grm34/archboot/wiki

# ARCHBOOT SYSTEM MANAGEMENT
# ============================================================================
# Here we defined all required variables and functions to manage archboot.
# Variables are pretty simple such as define needed url and colors.
# Functions are used to display install steps, notes, errors or to do some
# actions like cleanup after fatal error, execute cmd in chrooted environment,
# select an option, ask some informations to the user or to get install logs.
